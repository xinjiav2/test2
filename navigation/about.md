My name is Zhengji Li, in chinese it is 李正佶
where 李 is the surname and 正佶 is the given name.
正 is a relatively common name, meaning straight/upright

佶 is much more rare, and it is a combaniation of the radical meaning one person and 吉 meaning lucky, overall this word has two meanings, meaning both lucky and healthy.

Yay that part of the thing is done.

I am intersted into many things, these being video games. And video games. Did i mention video games?
Some of the games I play are mostly made by mihoyou, and include Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail and Zenless Zone Zero. I also play Project Sekai and Minecraft.!
